This is the GitHub repository for a project to predict domoic acid contamination in California fisheries and aquaculture species. It is a collaboration between Chris Free (UCSB), Eric Bjorkstedt (NOAA), Raphael Kudela (UCSC), Lyall Bellquist (TNC), and Clarissa Anderson (Scripps). This work was funded by The Nature Conservancy (TNC).

The following paper is currently in preparation:

Free CM, Kudela RM, Bjorkstedt EP, Bellquist LF, Anderson CR. Predicting toxin contamination in harvested marine species to guide dynamic ocean management. Near submission.
