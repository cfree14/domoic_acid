# Predicting domoic acid contamination in California seafood species

This is the GitHub repository for a project seeking to predict domoic acid contamination in California fisheries and aquaculture species.

The project is being conducted by [emLab](http://emlab.msi.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara with funding from [TNC](https://www.nature.org/en-us/) and is a collaboration between Chris Free (UCSB), Clarissa Anderson (Scripps), Eric Bjorkstedt (NOAA), Raphael Kudela (UCSC), and Lyall Bellquist (TNC).

The repository contains the data and code for the following paper in preparation:

Free CM, Kudela RM, Bjorkstedt EP, Bellquist LF, Anderson CR. Predicting toxin contamination in harvested marine species to guide dynamic ocean management. Near submission.
